# node_modules

This artificial `node_modules` folder is required for testing a special issue with nested module resolved file name tracking. We populate `Shim._moduleRoot` with this value and use that for subsequent `shim.require()` calls. When the value is wrong, we can fail to properly trigger certain instrumentation. Since our code has a regex that explicitly checks for `node_modules` when populating `_moduleRoot`, we need to load from a similar path to exercise.
